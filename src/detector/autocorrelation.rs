//! Autocorrelation is one of the most basic forms of pitch detection. Let $S=(s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_N)$
//! be a discrete signal. Then, the autocorrelation function of $S$ at time $t$ is
//! $$ A_t(S) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-t} s_i s_{i+t}. $$
//! The autocorrelation function is largest when $t=0$. Subsequent peaks indicate when the signal
//! is particularly well aligned with itself. Thus, peaks of $A_t(S)$ when $t>0$ are good candidates
//! for the fundamental frequency of $S$.
//!
//! Unfortunately, autocorrelation-based pitch detection is prone to octave errors, since a signal
//! may "line up" with itself better when shifted by amounts larger than by the fundamental frequency.
//! Further, autocorrelation is a bad choice for situations where the fundamental frequency may not
//! be the loudest frequency (which is common in telephone speech and for certain types of instruments).
//!
//! ## Implementation
//! Rather than compute the autocorrelation function directly, an [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)
//! is used, providing a dramatic speed increase for large buffers.
